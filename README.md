# Crylia Theme

This theme is inspired by simple bar and many other things that I think look good and fit my theme. AwesomeWM lets you configure your desktop as you want, no compromises, the sky is the limit!
This is the reason I choose AwesomeWM.

## Quick Install

---

Installing my theme is rather easy, just copy the repo and put the awesome folder to ~/.config/
But in order for it to work as seen you need some dependencies installed along the way

||Arch|Ubuntu|Why?|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Command|sudo pacman -S ( yay -S for <sup>aur</sup> )|sudo apt install||
|AwesomeWM|awesome|awesome|Its your Window Manager lol|
|Rofi|rofi|rofi|For the application launcher|
|Picom|picom-ibhagwan-git<sup>aur</sup>|[Guide here]()|Compositor, needed for transparency/blur/effects/animations etc|

## TODO

---

This is my 1.0 release, meaning that I will add many more features as time goes on. At this state the config is usable on (hopefully) all systems complying with my dependency list.

- [ ] Independent Application launcher
- [ ] Alt+Tab like Window switcher
- [ ] Switching trough Keyboard layouts using \<*super*\>+\<*space*\>(like on gnome where you hold down super)
- [ ] System tray needs a lot of work (maybe an own implementation)
- [ ] Manual tiling layout like i3
- [ ] Interactive calendar with online support

## Features

---

Some would say there are more features than a WM needs, I say you can never have enough features (as long as they make some sense).

- [x] Multi screen support
- [x] Interactive taskbar (left, right click and hover over)
- [x] Session option to reboot, shutdown etc
- [x] Multi keyboard layout support + switch widget
- [x] Calendar widget (not interactive)
- [x] Rofi application launcher and window switcher
- [x] Volume / Brightness switcher

I've added various widgets you can choose or remove how you like it.

__Including__:<br>
Battery, Network (Wifi, Ethernet), Bluetooth, Volume, Keyboardlayout, Date (with Calendar), Time, Session options, Taglist, Tasklist, Layoutswitcher.
